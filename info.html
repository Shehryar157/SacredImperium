<h2>History and culture</h2>
<p>I think this text can be improved, but I don't feel like doing it rn cause too lazy</p>
<h3>introduction</h3>
<p>TheHolyEmpireOfChristinaPerri, founded on twenty third march, 2024, has a relatively short history but a rather diverse culture.</p>
<p>The flag of this empire has a circle, drawn in green, that covers the top, inside which is a white sword that points to the left. Right below the sword is an inscription in arabic that reads, "Al-majd lil-imbratouriya al-muqaddasa li-Christina Perri!"</p>
<p>Below the circle is a firey red stripe running all the way from the left edge to the right, with an ant in its very center. The ant seems to be breathing fire from its mouth and its eyes make it look as if it was enraged.</p>
<p>Lastly, at the bottom of the flag is a 5 pointed star, on which a figure in plate armor stands, a saber clutched in one hand and a pistol in the other, both raised in front of him, making the figure look battleready. Another inscription right above the star reads, "Forever stronk like powerfulwarrior!".</p>
<p>The national anthem of this empire is named a thousand years and its official version can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtOvBOTyX00&pp=ygUbdGluYSBwZXJyeSBhIHRob3VzYW5kIHllYXJz">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The culture of this empire is widely diverse, owing to the diversity among the people that seem to come from all over the globe. Arabs and russians make up a majority of the population, nearly 60%, while south-Asians make up a considerable 20%. Additionally, East-Asians also seem to make up a prominant 15% of the total population. The remaining 5% consists of various minorities that include but are not limited to South-Americans and Africans.</p>
<h3>Common traditions and festivals</h3>
<p>Apart from the religious festivals, one of the most well-known, and perhaps most liked days of the year is "Za shawarma day". A fair is prepared in the heart of the capital of the empire, where the most skilled of the skilled shawarmamen [people who have unparalleled skill at preparing Middle-Eastern foods] are called. Every participant is then given the chance to set up a stall, or if they can, a small temporary shop and present their foods to the staggering number of people present. Attendees are encouraged to rate the food and show their support for their favourite shawarmaman, and at the end of the festival which lasts for 3 days, prizemoney is given to the one with the highest rating.</p>
<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>Emperor Aditya Shah, the first and current emperor, has been ruling for a quite brief period of time. Though he hasn't been able to do a lot in the last few months for the good of the lands under his control, he is still hailed as a just and reasonable ruler by a majority of the people, nearly 83% according to the census of august 2024.</p>
<p>Most of the major decisions are made after consulting and with the consent of his two advisers, Muhammad Shehryar Tariq and Kavya, both of whom seem to be South-Asians.</p>
