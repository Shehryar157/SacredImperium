<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Greetings. I am not sure why exactly I have made this website or what I will end up using this for in the future, but I know that at least for now, this is not going to be public. It does, however, make for a nice practice project.</p>
<p>Hopefully, I will move to using django for hosting and managing this site in the future, but seeing as I have spent nearly two or so hours trying to deploy my already made site and haven't achieved much progress, I think I am not ready to go back to it quite at the moment.</p>
